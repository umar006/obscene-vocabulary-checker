# About

Today, many popular platforms on the Internet use artificial intelligence to filter out offensive comments and posts. Building such a filter requires a lot of skill and knowledge. There is another way to hide obscene words in the comments. Of course, it is not as effective as artificial intelligence, but it will do the job. The Obscene Vocabulary Checker is a simple console program that finds certain words and replaces them with **\*\***.
